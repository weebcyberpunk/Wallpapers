# The Weeb Cyberpunk Wallpapers

This is my own set of wallpapers, featuring a bunch of different types of wallpapers that I like.  

There are some cities wallpapers, some anime girls wallpapers, aesthetic, etc.  

You are free to clone the repo and use the images for any purpose, as I do not own any rights on third's wallpapers and I give any permission for copying, editing, reposting, using (for non-comercial or comercial use case) for my own images.
